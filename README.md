# Fish-Weight-Prediction-Application- :tropical_fish:


## This machine learning project illustrates how the model is deployed and it can be a sample for other big projects. We have done the deployment part using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), which is a dashboarding tool 


There are three main python files to build the application.

- model.py — Build ML model and Save it.
- prediction.py — Test saved ML model.
- main.py — The main file to run the web app.


### You can get the friendly dashboard to predicate the fish weight by download the files from this repo and run the following commands :

1. Install necessary libraries:
Here in requirements.txt, I created all necessary libraries to install. You can download the file and install it using:
```python
pip install requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Streamlit tool:
```python
     streamlit run main.py
```

Note: If you can't download the libraries, just clean the version from the requirements.txt file.
